# React Portfolio
Rebuilding my portfolio with react and styled components.

## The problem
I broke the project down to whick part would need to be reusable all over the site. I did a lot in global styling to reuse parts but I would also like to have more reusable components and more props. In the future I would also like to connect it with an API to Github and Medion instead of using a local json file.
